# Bcrypt Security Vulnerabilities: Lessons from Okta's Incident

This repository demonstrates the limitations of Bcrypt, a widely used password hashing library, and how these limitations can contribute to security vulnerabilities. Using the Okta breach as a case study, we explore critical lessons for developers in cryptography and secure coding practices.

## Overview

Password hashing is a critical part of modern security practices, but even trusted tools like Bcrypt have their limitations. This project demonstrates these limitations through a code example and examines the role Bcrypt played in the Okta security breach.

By analyzing this incident, we provide actionable insights for developers to avoid similar pitfalls and ensure better security practices.

----------

## Key Points

-   Highlights Bcrypt's limitations in handling specific scenarios.
-   Provides real-world context with the Okta security breach.
-   Offers best practices for developers regarding secure password hashing.
-   Demonstrates the issue with a hands-on code example.

----------

## Problem Statement

While Bcrypt is widely used for hashing passwords due to its computationally expensive design, certain use cases can expose vulnerabilities. The Okta breach showed how reliance on Bcrypt without understanding its constraints can lead to exploitable weaknesses.


-   Why Bcrypt was insufficient in this case.
-   How misuse or inadequate configuration of Bcrypt can expose vulnerabilities.

----------

## Insights and Lessons

1.  **Bcrypt's Limitations**
    
    -   Struggles with extremely long passwords or edge cases.
    -   Vulnerable to computational attacks with inadequate salting or iteration counts.
2.  **Okta Incident Analysis**
    
    -   Misconfiguration or insufficient understanding of Bcrypt's characteristics led to exploitable weaknesses.
    -   Highlights the need for comprehensive testing and understanding of security libraries.
3.  **Best Practices for Developers**
    
    -   Use appropriate iteration counts (e.g., cost factor) depending on your application's requirements.
    -   Consider modern alternatives like Argon2 for password hashing.
    -   Regularly audit and update cryptographic configurations.
    -   Educate yourself on the latest cryptographic standards and threats.
